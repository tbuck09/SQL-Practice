# SQL-Practice
This is the repository for the DU Data Analytics Bootcamp Module-9 homework for practice writing and executing simple SQL scripts.

The sections of the homework assignment have been split into separate .sql files in the hopes that the results are easier to look through. (i.e. 1a and 1b are found within SQL_Homework1.sql)
